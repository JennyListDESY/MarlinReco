A new MVA based Isolated Lepton Tagging Processor
### -- C.Duerig & J.Tian
### see recent introduction
https://agenda.linearcollider.org/event/6787/session/10/contribution/17/material/slides/0.pdf


#a minimum instruction to use
1.) see steering in example/isolep.xml
2.) make sure to set the correct links to weights trained by MVA
3.) several weights trained for different analyses are available, but the dependence shall be rather weak;
    the existing ones are insed weights/ (released together with this package)
4.) the default processor "IsolatedLeptonProcessor" selects one isoalted lepton with highest tagging;
    one can just change the flag in steering "isSelectingOneIsoLep" to select all possible ones
5.) output collection "ISOLeptons", associated by parameter "ISOLepTagging" which can be further used to
    apply cut, and "ISOLepType" which is 13 for muon, and is 11 for electron.

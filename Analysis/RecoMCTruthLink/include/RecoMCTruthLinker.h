/** Creates four collections of LCRelations ("recoMCTruthLink", "trackMCTruthLink", "clusterMCTruthLink",
 *  ""clusterMCTruthLink" and "calohitMCTruthLink") with weighetd relations between true particles
 *  and reconstructed particles, tracks, clusters,  and calorimeter hits, respectively.
 *  The first is always created, the other three on request. By default, the first three are
 *  created.
 * 
 *  This relation is based on the number of hits for tracks, for hits weighted with the
 *  SimHit-energy for clusters and calorimeter hits. For tracks and clusters, the weight
 *  is the sum of hits from the considered true particle divided by the sum of all hits,
 *  for calorimter hits, it's simply the simHit energy of the hit.
 *  For the reconstructed particles, the relation could either be only to the true particle
 *  having the largest weight, or to all contributing true particles. In the former case,
 *  the pointer (and weight) will concern the true particle creating hits in the tracker,
 *  if there are any. Only for track-less seen particles would it point to the main
 *  contributor to the cluster. In the latter case, pointers are set up to all contributing
 *  true particles, and the weight is givean as (fractional contribution to track)+
 *  10000* (fractional contribution to cluster), with fractions given in permil (int).
 *  Hence: trackwgt = (int(wgt)%10000)/1000. and  clusterwgt = (int(wgt)/10000)/1000. 
 *  Which of the two is used is selected by the processor flag "FullRecoRelation" (default=true)
 *
 *  Setting the flag "FullRecoRelation" to false gives the same interpretation of "recoMCTruthLink" as 
 *  in the old version of the processor. If, in  addition "OutputTrackRelation" and  "OutputClusterRelation" 
 *  are also changed from the default true value to false, the created  output collections also agrees 
 *  with the old behaviour.
 *
 *  The calohitMCTruthLink LCRelation fixes errors in the "SimCalorimeterHitRelation", so that
 *  the originating true particle is always a particle entering the calorimeter : either it starts 
 *  outside a calorimeter, and ends inside, or back-scatters inside a calorimeter, then also ends 
 *  inside, but is not in the same cluster as it's pre-backscatter ancestors. Note that this is 
 *  a relation CalorimeterHit <-> MCParticle, not  SimCalorimeterHit <-> MCParticle as the 
 *  "SimCalorimeterHitRelation !
 *
 *  If a neutral particle with one cluster has no MC contribution assigned the MCParticle 
 *  pointing closest to the cluster is assigned and the weight is set to the negative scalar product
 *  of the MCParticle's momentum direction and the direction to the Cluster position. 
 *  (This fixes a bug in the Mokka LCal driver ov mokka-v06-06-p03).
 *
 *  <p>
 *  A skimmed MCParticle subset collection is created. It containes all particles created by the generator 
 *  program and all particles that have been reconstructed including all their parents.
 *  Additionally, the daughters of all decays in flight of particles specified in 'KeepDaughtersPDG' 
 *  (default: gamma, K0s and pi0) are kept in the skimmed list if the original particle 
 *  is in the skim ( either from the generator or from  reconstruction).

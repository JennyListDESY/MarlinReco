GammaGammaSolutionFinder Processor

Purpose: Assemble a collection of ReconstructedParticles consisting of pairs of photons fitted to known 
         particles which can decay to two photons, including 
         pi0 -> gamma gamma, eta0 -> gamma gamma, etaprime(958)0 -> gamma gamma, and which represent 
         a potential solution of the di-photon assignment problem in the event where no constituent photon is 
         used more than once.

Method:  Read in candidates potentially from the following three collections: 
         1. GammaGammaCandidatePi0s
         2. GammaGammaCandidateEtas
         3. GammaGammaCandidateEtaPrimes
         and select a "solution" set of GammaGammaCandidates from the 3 collections that 
         does not double count any constituent photon.
         The output collection is a GammaGammaSolution collection of ReconstructedParticles.

Solution Finder Algorithm:
         Given n photons and m GammaGammaCandidates, 
         the current implementation essentially does an exhaustive search of all possible 
         matchings in the graph with n vertices (photons) and m edges (GammaGammaCandidates). 
         The chosen matching with r GammaGammaCandidates is the solution amongst those 
         with the largest possible value of r (at most n/2) which has the lowest global fit chi-squared.
         Only solutions containing pi0s and etas are considered for the "best solution".
         Solutions are required to use each photon at most once.
         The algorithm is highly factorial and there is some CPU timing monitoring included. 
         In cases where the expected solution time based on an estimate of the number of combinations that will need 
         to be explored (controlled by MaxCombinationsCut steering parameter) the solution is chosen as the "greedy solution".

The GammaGammaSolution collection will then be used in a downstream processor to create an updated PFO collection containing 
the ReconstructedParticles of the GammaGammaSolution collection and the original PandoraPFOs that 
are NOT the photon constituent ReconstructedParticles of the GammaGammaSolution collection. 
This updated PFO collection, provisionally named DistilledPFOs, can be used as a replacement 
for PandoraPFOs in jet energy reconstruction.

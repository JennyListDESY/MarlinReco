2008-07-01 15:18  gaede

	* make error message more visible

2008-07-01 15:08  aplin

	* An Error message has been added as an event parameter for the
	  case where the PATREC fails due to too many links.
	  
	  Only one track collection is now produced, namely "TPCTracks", as
	  LEPTracking now only produces hits from the TPC. FullLDCTracking
	  is now responsible for creating tracks including hits from the
	  silicon detectors.

2008-07-01 15:07  gaede

	* updated documentation

2008-07-01 15:05  gaede

	* protected against non-existing SimTrackerHits, e.g. from noise
	  hits

2008-07-01 10:34  aplin

	* The functionality of CurlKiller has been moved into LEPTracking.
	  It is
	  now operated at increasing levels of aggression in order to try
	  to
	  save the event from not not having ANY TPC Tracks, due to too
	  many links in
	  trslnk.
	  
	  As a first try, all hits are passed to the PATREC. If this fails
	  three
	  more attempts are made where the size of the bins used to find
	  high
	  levels of multiplicity in r-phi are increased by factors of 2, 3
	  and
	  finally 4. If this still fails an error message is printed
	  warning
	  that NO TPC Tracks will be reconstructed for this event.
	  
	  The verbosity of LEPTracking is now controlled completely via
	  streamlog on the C++ side, and via flags set in tkinit on the F77
	  side.

2008-06-30 13:54  aplin

	* removed hard coded number for padwith

	  look for two tracks where total tpc hits are not more than total
	  number
	  of pad rows and that the hits on one track are close to the helix
	  of the
	  other track. (Code Supplied by Mark Thomson)

2008-06-26 16:22  aplin

	* arrays and printout, once again

2008-06-26 15:14  aplin

	* corrected debug fromat statement

2008-06-26 09:35  aplin

	* A clean up has been made of the arrays that hold the TE's/Hits
	  for
	  track fitting. An effort has been made to ensure that both the
	  arrays
	  are big enough to hold the required number of hits, and that the
	  arrays
	  are all of the same dimensions between calling routines.
	  
	  All verbose output, except for the case where the tracking is
	  dropped
	  for a complete event, has now been hidden behind debug IF
	  Statements. The level of verbosity can be controlled via the
	  variables
	  TPCDBG, TKSTDBG, FSFDBG and IDEB in tkinit.F

2008-06-20 10:34  aplin

2008-01-23 17:22  aplin

	* The TPC Tracking code has been altered to cope with more than 224
	  pad rows
	  the max number of pad rows can be changed in padrow.inc by
	  changing
	  
	  The maximum number of TPC Padrows that the tracking code
	  can accept must be a multiple of 32
	  
	  Note this is not the number of TPC Padrows in the dectector
	  but the maximum allowed because of the predifined array sizes
	  and a set of 32 bit registers
	  
	  Currently it is set to 512
	  
	  By increasing the value of N32BITREG in padrow.inc you can
	  increase the max
	  number of pad rows

	  innerrad, float* outerrad, int* npadrows, float* maxdrift, float*
	  tpcpixz, float* ionpoten, float* tpcrpres, float* tpczres, float*

	  fxambi. The material description of the vtx detector, as for the
	  TPC, is hard coded in setmat. Presently the VTX and SIT
	  resolutions are hard coded in LEPTrackingProcessor. The debug
	  output has been reduced and can be controlled via TKSTDBG etc. in
	  tkinit.F. delsolve contains the delphi ambuguity resolver written
	  in C and is contained in the directory named C. The Tk's are
	  written back into the C++ side in tktrev. The corresponding Tk
	  bank structure analogous to the TE bank structure has been added
	  in tktkbank whilst the access wrapper functions are contained in
	  LEPTracking.

	  = 1000 in src/f77/include/my_tcrl.inc ) , and ensured the
	  tracking is skipped in the event when this number of hits is
	  exceeded (tcobin.F).

2005-08-08 10:26  aplin

	* Updated documentation

2005-08-08 07:09  aplin

	* Made f77 tracking code use GEAR to define the geomtery of the
	  TPC. LTPDRO now defines the maximum number of rows is used to
	  define the size of arrays, this is limited to 224 due the use of
	  7 '32 bit' bit registers in trkfnd.F increased, though at present
	  it is not likely that anybody would want more. The number of TPC
	  padrows is defined at run time by NRTPC which should of course
	  not exceed LTPDRO, although this is checked and the programe
	  exits with a verbose error message. A wrapper function gettpcgeom
	  is used to pass the GEAR TPC parameters from C++ to f77.
	  MarlinUtil/include/marlin_tpcgeom.h have
	  MarlinUtil/src/marlin_tpcgeom.cc consequently been removed as
	  they are no longer needed.

2005-07-27 08:26  krstonos

	* initial version of processor for calculation fox-wolfram moments

2005-07-26 17:56  aplin

	* Removed unecessary initialisation of hit arrays which is now done
	  in
	  tktrev. Corrected (finaly) the calculation of d0 in
	  LEPTrackingProcessor.

2005-07-25 15:57  aplin

	* Corrected the calculation of d0 in LEPTrackingProcessor

2005-07-21 16:37  aplin

	* The itedat bank has been added with read and write interface.
	  
	  TKADDH has now been added so that the silicon hits are included
	  as
	  TE's.
	  
	  Added FSFSTR from delsearch to steer the creation of
	  TS's
	  
	  The following include files need to be added for FSFSTR
	  include/fsfdebug.inc
	  include/fsfreject.inc
	  include/fsfflags.inc
	  
	  FSFSTR is now called by TKTREV although all action is commented
	  out.

2005-07-20 17:49  aplin

	* added Doxyfile file for VTXDigi

2005-07-20 17:46  aplin

	* The itedat bank has been added with read and write interface.
	  Though
	  only the write function is used (tkstor). The read will have to
	  be
	  done through a statement function.

2005-07-20 16:03  krstonos

	* compatibility wiht gcc 3.4

2005-07-19 17:02  aplin

	* Removed using namespace from .h files. Commented out remove hit
	  from tkbank, as well as adding methods to give information about
	  the number and positions of subdetector hit collections with in
	  the bank structure. Common block CNTPC no longer needed so
	  commented out in tpchitbank.h, and else where it was accessed.
	  Added protocalls for cfortran.h for the new tkbank methods.
	  Replaced TPCRUN as the main tracking steering routine by TKTREV
	  which itself calls TPCRUN.

2005-07-19 09:43  aplin

	* Changed the name of FortranProcessor to LEPTrackingProccesor

2005-07-19 07:01  aplin

	* included the layer number in type property

2005-07-19 06:58  aplin

	* Corrected subid for the VTX to include the layer number

2005-07-18 15:51  aplin

	* included math.h in include/random.h and, cmath and namespace std
	  in src/TPCDigiProcessor.cc

2005-07-18 15:35  aplin

	* added to provide vtx hits as TrackerHit Collection. Initial
	  version.

2005-07-18 15:33  aplin

	* added vtx hits to the tkbank. included collection names as
	  steering parameters. changed variable names to conform to coding
	  standards

2005-07-17 19:47  aplin

	* removed the dependance of external geometry processor and
	  implemented GEAR. GeomInit was corrected as the pixel dimentions
	  and the resolution were mixed up.

2005-07-17 19:44  aplin

	* removed dependence on external geometry processors and fully
	  implemented GEAR. Note:the function to get pad width does not
	  appear to give sensible values so the value of 2.2mm has been
	  hard coded until this is resolved.

2005-07-17 11:04  aplin

	* clean up documentation

2005-07-17 10:58  aplin

	* reduced warnings produced by cerlib by compliling with
	  -Wno-Global

2005-07-13 21:11  aplin

	* added TrackingPerformanceProcessor to MarlinReco. This processor
	  has ROOT dependance which is contained within #ifdefs

2005-07-12 17:12  aplin

	* made more use of GEAR though still not fully used

2005-07-12 14:33  aplin

	* added emacs C++ mode lines

2005-07-11 15:58  aplin

	* first implementaion using GEAR

2005-07-11 15:15  aplin

	* This commit was generated by cvs2svn to compensate for changes in
	  r6,
	  which included commits to RCS files with non-trunk default
	  branches.

2005-07-11 15:15  

	* Standard project directories initialized by cvs2svn.

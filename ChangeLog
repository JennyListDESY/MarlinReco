	  still performed along the ladders if they are found to exist in
	  the GEAR file, otherwise cylindrical smearing is performed. This
	  can be forced by setting the steering parameter
	  _smearAlongLadders to 0. Hits which are found to not be within
	  the width of the sensitive layer as stated in the GEAR file are
	  dropped.

	* [r1114] ---------- version v00-08 ---------------------

2008-07-01 15:18  gaede

	* [r1113] make error message more visible

2008-07-01 15:08  aplin

	* [r1112] An Error message has been added as an event parameter for
	  the case where the PATREC fails due to too many links.
	  
	  Only one track collection is now produced, namely "TPCTracks", as
	  LEPTracking now only produces hits from the TPC. FullLDCTracking
	  is now responsible for creating tracks including hits from the
	  silicon detectors.

2008-07-01 15:07  gaede

	* [r1111] updated documentation

2008-07-01 15:05  gaede

	  noise hits

2008-07-01 10:34  aplin

	* [r1108] The functionality of CurlKiller has been moved into
	  LEPTracking. It is
	  now operated at increasing levels of aggression in order to try
	  to
	  save the event from not not having ANY TPC Tracks, due to too
	  many links in
	  trslnk.
	  
	  As a first try, all hits are passed to the PATREC. If this fails
	  three
	  more attempts are made where the size of the bins used to find
	  high
	  levels of multiplicity in r-phi are increased by factors of 2, 3
	  and
	  finally 4. If this still fails an error message is printed
	  warning
	  that NO TPC Tracks will be reconstructed for this event.
	  
	  The verbosity of LEPTracking is now controlled completely via
	  streamlog on the C++ side, and via flags set in tkinit on the F77
	  side.

	  of the
	  other track. (Code Supplied by Mark Thomson)

2008-06-26 09:35  aplin

	* [r1086] A clean up has been made of the arrays that hold the

	  arrays
	  are big enough to hold the required number of hits, and that the
	  arrays
	  are all of the same dimensions between calling routines.
	  
	  All verbose output, except for the case where the tracking is
	  dropped
	  for a complete event, has now been hidden behind debug IF
	  Statements. The level of verbosity can be controlled via the
	  variables
	  TPCDBG, TKSTDBG, FSFDBG and IDEB in tkinit.F

2008-02-11 16:51  aplin

	  It is parameterised in phi and theta. Not yet in z.
	  
	  The Covariance matrix has been corrected so that it is set for
	  XYZ and not r-phi as previously.
	  The corresponding conversion back to r-phi has been set in
	  LEPTracking and FullLDCTracking.
	  
	  Code also added to provide detailed histogramming, which can be
	  enabled for complilation by setting the ifdef STEVESCHECKPLOTS 1
	  in tpcdigiproccessor.h

2008-02-11 16:21  aplin

2008-01-23 17:22  aplin

	* [r866] The TPC Tracking code has been altered to cope with more
	  than 224 pad rows
	  the max number of pad rows can be changed in padrow.inc by
	  changing
	  
	  The maximum number of TPC Padrows that the tracking code
	  can accept must be a multiple of 32
	  
	  Note this is not the number of TPC Padrows in the dectector
	  but the maximum allowed because of the predifined array sizes
	  and a set of 32 bit registers
	  
	  Currently it is set to 512
	  
	  By increasing the value of N32BITREG in padrow.inc you can
	  increase the max
	  number of pad rows

	  SiliconTracking by Alexei Raspereza.

2007-12-12 11:53  aplin

	* [r822] Added hard coded number for the TPC cathode 5mm. Gear sets
	  max drift length but does not contain information about the
	  cathode. The TPC sensitive volume is therefor shifted in z and
	  the abs z coordinate can no longer be compared to the max drift
	  length.

2007-12-03 17:37  aplin

	* [r817] Added an IF statement to skip SimTrackerHits with CellID <
	  1. These hits are only space-point like hits and do not lie at
	  the centre of the tpc pad ring radius. A complete solution should
	  be found to make use of these hits and pass them to the pattern
	  recognition.

	  output has been reduced and can be controlled via TKSTDBG etc. in
	  tkinit.F. delsolve contains the delphi ambuguity resolver written
	  in C and is contained in the directory named C. The Tk's are
	  written back into the C++ side in tktrev. The corresponding Tk
	  bank structure analogous to the TE bank structure has been added
	  in tktkbank whilst the access wrapper functions are contained in
	  LEPTracking.

	* [r150] Updated documentation

2005-08-08 07:09  aplin

	* [r148] Made f77 tracking code use GEAR to define the geomtery of
	  the TPC. LTPDRO now defines the maximum number of rows is used to
	  define the size of arrays, this is limited to 224 due the use of
	  7 '32 bit' bit registers in trkfnd.F increased, though at present
	  it is not likely that anybody would want more. The number of TPC
	  padrows is defined at run time by NRTPC which should of course
	  not exceed LTPDRO, although this is checked and the programe
	  exits with a verbose error message. A wrapper function gettpcgeom
	  is used to pass the GEAR TPC parameters from C++ to f77.
	  MarlinUtil/include/marlin_tpcgeom.h have
	  MarlinUtil/src/marlin_tpcgeom.cc consequently been removed as
	  they are no longer needed.

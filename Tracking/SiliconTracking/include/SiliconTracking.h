/** === Silicon Tracking Processor === <br>
 * Processor performing stand-alone pattern recognition
 * in the vertex detector (VXD) and forward tracking disks. <br>
 * The procedure consists of three steps : <br> 
 * 1) Tracking in VXD ; <br>
 * 2) Tracking in FTD ; <br>
 * 3) Merging compatible track segments reconstructed in VXD and FTD <br>
 * STEP 1 : TRACKING IN VXD <br>
 * Algorithm starts with finding of hit triplets satisfying helix hypothesis 
 * in three different layers. To accelerate procedure, the 4-pi solid angle
 * is divided in NDivisionsInTheta and NDivisionsInPhi sectors in cosQ and Phi, 
 * respectively. Triplets are looked for in 2x2 window of adjacent sectors. 
 * Once triplet is found, attempt is made to associate additional hits to 
 * track. Combinatin of hits is accepted for further analysis if the Chi2 
 * of the helix fit is less than certain predefined threshold. All accepted 
 * combinations are sorted in ascending order of their Chi2. First track candidate 
 * in the sorted array is automatically accepted. The hits belonging to this track are 
 * marked as used, and track candidates sharing these hits are discarded.
 * The procedure proceeds with increasing index of track candidate in the sorted 
 * array until all track candidate have been output or discarded. <br>
 * STEP 2 : TRACKING IN FTD <br>
 * In the next step tracking in FTD is performed. The strategy of tracking in the FTD 
 * is the same as used for tracking in the VXD.
 * STEP 3 : MERGING TRACK SEGMENTS FOUND IN FTD AND VXD <br>
 * In the last step, track segments reconstructed in the FTD and VXD, belonging to the
 * same track  are identified and merged into one track. All possible 
 * pairings are tested for their compatibility.
 * The number of pairings considered is Ntrk_VXD*Ntrk_FTD, where Ntrk_VXD is the number of 
 * track segments reconstructed in the first step in VXD (segments containing solely VXD hits) and  
 * Ntrk_FTD is the number of track segments reconstructed in the second step 
 * (segments containing solely FTD hits).
 * Pair of segments is accepted for further examination if the difference in tan(dip angle) 
 * and azimuthal angle
 * between segments is less than certain . Pairing satisfying this condition is subjected for 
 * addtitional test. The fit is performed on unified array of hits belonging to both segments. 
 * If the chi2 of the fit does not exceed predefined cut value two segments are unified into 
 * one track.     
 * <h4>Input collections and prerequisites</h4> 
 * Processor requires collection of digitized vertex tracker hits. <br>
 * If such a collection with the user specified name does not exist <br>
 * processor takes no action.
 * <h4>Output</h4>
 * Processor produces an LCIO collection of the Tracks. Each track is characterised by 
 * five parameters : Omega (signed curvuture), Phi (azimuthal angle), D0 (signed impact parameter),
 * Z0 (displacement along z axis at the point of closest approach to IP) and Tan(lambda) where
 * lambda is the dip angle. Covariance matrix for these parameters is also provided.
 * Output track collection has a name "VertexTracks". <br>

 * @param PhiCutForMerging cut on the difference in azimuthal angle for two track segments.  
 * If the difference is greater than this cut, segments are not allowed to be merged. <br>

 * to decide whether hit can be attached to the track. If the distance is less than 
 * cut value. The track is refitted with a given hit being added to the list of hits already 
 * assigned for the track. Additional hit is assigned if chi2 of the new fit has good chi2. <br>
 * (default value is 1 ) <br>
 * @param CutOnZ0 cut on Z0 parameter of track (in mm). If abs(Z0) is greater than the cut value, track is

/** Produces Track collection from TPC TrackerHit collections using LEP tracking algorithms. 
* The Processors BrahmsInitProcessor and GeomInitProcessor must be placed ahead in the steering file
* in order that the TPC geomerty and TKBank structre are previously instantiated. The Geometric information
* for the tpc is defined both for the C++ and F77 implementations in marlin_tpcgeom.h . The LEP algorithms 
* are taken from Brahms but does not contain the DELPHI ambiguity resolver. The track finding is based on  
*  1) SUBROUTINE CIRCLE  (N.CHERNOV, G. OSOSKOV )  
*     REFERENCE:  COMPUTER PHYSICS COMMUNICATIONS VOL 33,P329   
*  2) 3-DIMENSIONAL ITERACTION  (MARTIN POPPE)     
*     REFERENCE:  ALEPH NOTE 87-102
* The final track fitting is done using a Kalman filter. At present the both the magnetic field 
* and the material desciption of the TPC is hard coded into the Fortran code, this will be addressd once 
* the common geometry API becomes available.

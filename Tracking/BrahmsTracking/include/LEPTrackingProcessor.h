/** Produces Track collection from TPC TrackerHit collections using LEP tracking algorithms. 
* The Geometric information via GEAR. The f77 tracking code previously relied on ZEBRA banks, 
* these have been replace by C++ structures implemented in tkhitbank.h etc. There must be 
* instanitated and deleted at the begining and the end of the processor respectively.
*
* Currently only the TPC patrec and fitting is implemented, though plans to incorporate VTX
* hits into Tracks exist.
*
* The name of the TPC Track collection is specified in the steering file, togeather with the name 
* of the hit collections needed as input.
*
* For the track collection the following applys:
*
* The reference point is the Point of Closest Approach.
*
* All parameters are defined there.
*
* Phi is defined between -PI and +PI
*
* Z0 is the z coordinate of the PCA in the R-Phi plane.
*
* At present the covariance matrix is not filled.
*
*
* The LEP algorithms are taken from Brahms but does not contain the DELPHI ambiguity resolver. 
* The track finding is based on  
*  1) SUBROUTINE CIRCLE  (N.CHERNOV, G. OSOSKOV )  
*     REFERENCE:  COMPUTER PHYSICS COMMUNICATIONS VOL 33,P329   
*  2) 3-DIMENSIONAL ITERACTION  (MARTIN POPPE)     
*     REFERENCE:  ALEPH NOTE 87-102
*
* The final track fitting is done using a Kalman filter. At present the both the magnetic field 
* and the material desciption of the TPC is hard coded into the Fortran code and C++ code, 
* and will be improved when GEAR becomes more evolved.

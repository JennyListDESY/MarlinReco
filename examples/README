This directory contains example steering files for MarlinReco
package.

The directory LDC contains an example XML steering file and GEAR 
XML file for the LDC concept study detector needed for MarlinReco. 
For detailed information see LDC/README file.

Example steering XML file exampleVTX.xml is meant to illustrate 
VertexTracking processor running only on the vertex detector hits.
When running Marlin with this steering file, LCIO file 
top_vxd01.slcio is proccessed. This file contains LCIO collection 
hits produced in the vertex detector. 
The output file output.slcio is produced which contains also 
the collection of the reconstructed tracks in the vertex detector.

Example steering XML file example_VTX_FTD.xml is used to demonstrate
the extended functionality of the VertexTracking processor. 
When running Marlin with this steering file, a combined tracking 
in the vertex detector and forward tracking disks is performed. 
Tracks are output in Track collection, named VTXTracks, and output 
lcio file, named output.slcio, is produced. When running Marlin 
with example_VTX_FTD.xml steering file, the LCIO file 
top_6j_500GeV_silicon.slcio is processes. It contains LCIO collections 
of TrackerHits both in the vertex detector and FTD.

Content of the output LCIO files can be inspected with "dumpevt" utility
from $LCIO/bin directory.

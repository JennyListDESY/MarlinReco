This processor simulates the expected BeamCal response 
to single high energetic electrons, positrons and photons 
above the energy density from pair background.

It currently takes the MCParticlesSkimmed, tracks them to the BeamCal,
looks up the local background energy density and calculates the 
corresponding efficiency. A new collection of ReconstructedParticles
is created either with: 
- all e/gamma reaching the BCAL  (detectAll == 1)
- those passing passing a random number based acceptance-rejection 
  procedure                      (detectAll == 0)

The efficiency for each particle can be accessed via
ReconstructedParticle::getGoodnessOfPID()

In addition, a root tree is written out for detailed studies.
